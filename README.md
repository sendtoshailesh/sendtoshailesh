If you prefer a different tone (casual, professional, academic) or a minimal vs. detailed layout, tell me which and I’ll adapt.

How would you like to proceed?
- I will fetch your GitHub repos and generate a README populated from them (I’ll try again to fetch automatically).
- OR: Paste a list of your repos (name + 1-line description) and I’ll produce a finished README and optionally commit it for you if you give the repo owner and branch details.
- OR: I commit this template as-is into your profile repo (if you want that, tell me the repository owner and branch and I can push it).
```
