## About
I solve complex, high‑impact problems at the intersection of AI, Data, and large‑scale Cloud Transformation. As a Lead Specialist in Microsoft’s Global Black Belt team, I shape technical strategy and deliver architecture for strategic enterprise customers — spanning Azure, GitHub, and the Microsoft AI ecosystem. With 22+ years across Microsoft, AWS, Google Cloud, Oracle, and IBM, I focus on execution over theory: shipping production-ready, secure, and scalable systems that deliver measurable business outcomes.

Core strengths: enterprise migrations, cloud-scale data architecture, GenAI/LLM adoption, and modernization in regulated industries (BFSI, Healthcare, Global Enterprises). I’m passionate about technical rigor, clarity, and mentoring engineering teams.

If you'd like this README to be more compact, more technical (focus on code & repos), or more narrative (focus on leadership & outcomes), tell me which tone to use and I’ll adapt it. I can also:
- Fetch your GitHub repos and auto-fill the Featured Projects section with the top 3 projects (and include README excerpts), or
- Prepare the exact git commands to create and push this README to the profile repo (sendtoshailesh/sendtoshailesh) if you want me to generate the commit instructions.
